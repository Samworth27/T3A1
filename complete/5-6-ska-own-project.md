## Q5 - With reference to one of your own projects, discuss what knowledge or skills were required to complete your project, and to overcome challenges

Mid 2021 while attempting to learn python I decided to try build a neural network system. After some research I decided to attempt a build a common network, one for identifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

Prior to beginning the project I had a basic understanding of the properties of neural networks and the requirements for training them.
I had a basic understanding of the Python language but had experience with other languages prior to this project.

My knowledge of Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) was not enough to be able to build such a network so I began to research into them more.
This research led to discovering gaps in knowledge around mathematical processes and algorithms required for the training of a CNN.

Ultimately my ability to research and search the internet ended up being the most valuable skill leading to the completion of this project as I was not able to complete it unassisted and relied on articles to break down the processes into something I could understand and replicate myself.

After getting a working system I decided I wanted to be able to see what was happening. This resulted into further research into existing libraries for image processing in Python.
The "images" from the dataset were a list of characters representing the darkness value at a pixel. I was first able to use my existing knowledge on list, arrays and the screen space to build an 2D array of values for the input images that I was able to feed into image processing libraries to output a small image.

I extended this to build heat maps of the individual CNN layers.
Using knowledge of the colour space to build a 2D image with negative weights in the CNN layer being represented as red, and positive as green.

The image processing I was able to achieve using only library documentation and my own knowledge, problem solving and persistence.

## Q6 - With reference to one of your own projects, evaluate how effective your knowledge and skills were for this project, and suggest changes or improvements for future projects of a similar nature

Entering into this project I overestimated my knowledge and understanding of all processes involved and ended was not able to complete the project by myself.

However my ability to research, problem solve and learn, combined with persistence led to me being able to complete the project with some assistance and ended up with adding extra features beyond the initial scope of what I wanted to do and what I knew how to do.

In future before attempting another project like this I would want to have a more in depth knowledge of the language I would be using for the project.
I would break down the problems and processes required for the project into modular processes I can learn and complete one at a time before incrementally combining them into a single working system completely of my own work and design.
