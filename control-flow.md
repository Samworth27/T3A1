## Q7 - Explain control flow, using an example from the JavaScript programming language

, the first is Sequential Flow the second is Selection and the third is Repetition.

### Sequential Structures
This is the default behaviour for most programming languages.
Lines of code are executed in the order they are declared.


### Conditional/ Choice structures

#### IF Statement

The most basic conditional structure is the `if` statement. It allows you to execute blocks of code if certain conditions are met.

```javascript
if(condition){
  execute_code();
}
```

The `if` statement can be extended with the use of an `else` statement. This allows the user to specify and alternate block of code to be executed if the initial condition is not met.

```javascript
if(condition){
  execute_code();
}else{
  fallback_code();
}
```
